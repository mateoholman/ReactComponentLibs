Component libraries allow you to speed up UI development.
They often enforce development approaches and best practices.
They minimize decision fatigue.
They allow you to ship an MVP / product faster.
They help keep your code readable and maintainable.

Choosing a library will depend on what you need.
There are a shitton of options out there.
