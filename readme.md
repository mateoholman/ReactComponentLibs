# Choosing a React Component Library

Component libraries allow you to speed up UI development.
They often enforce development approaches and best practices.
They minimize decision fatigue.
They allow you to ship an MVP / product faster.
They help keep your code readable and maintainable.

Choosing a library will depend on what you need.
There are a shitton of options out there.
